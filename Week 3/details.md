CSV Files and Basic Statistics in Java Module
A common format for storing tabular data (any data organized into columns and rows) is in comma separated values (CSV) files. In this module, you will learn how to analyze and manipulate data from multiple CSV data files using a powerful open-source software package: Apache Commons CSV. Using this library will empower you to solve problems that could prove too complex to solve with a spreadsheet.

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
-Use the open-source Apache Commons CSV package in your own Java programs;
-Access data from one or many CSV files using Java;
-Convert strings into numbers;
-Understand how to use “null” in Java programs (when you want to represent “nothing”);
-Devise an algorithm (and implement in Java) to answer questions about CSV data; and
-Analyze CSV data across multiple CSV files (for example, find maximums, minimums, averages, and other simple statistical results).
